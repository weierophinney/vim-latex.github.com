	Features
	* remoteOpen.vim:
		Add a command :RemoteOpen which is to be used in applications such as
		YAP to make vim use the same session to open files. (SA)
	
	Bugfixes
	* texviewer.vim:
		Problem: <F9> did not work in standard vim + cygwin combination.
		Solution: Use single quotes instead of double-quotes when issuing
		          shell commands. (SA)
	* texviewer.vim:
		Problem: <F9> did not work for \includegraphics[0.8\columnwidth]{}
		         because it would confuse \columnwidth for a command instead
				 of an option.
		Solution: improve regexp for extracting command from a line. (SA)
	* envmacros.vim:
		Problem: the maps in envmacros.vim got applied only to the first file
		         which latex-suite sees.
		Solution: fix a typo in the autocommand line. (SA)
	* compiler.vim,wizardfuncs.vim:
		Problem: the log preview window did not appear during part
		         compilation.
		Solution: rearranged code in the files so the main filename was
		          defined even for part compilation. (SA)
	* texviewer.vim:
		Problem: <F9> only works for the first file.
		Solution: call the function to set the maps every time. (SA)
	* compiler.vim:
		Problem: sometimes, <F9> would try to search for completions in /*.tex
		         and would therefore fail.
		Solution: use expand('%:p:h') instead of expand('%;h') to calculate
		          directory because the latter can sometimes evaluate to ''. (SA)
	* texviewer.vim:
		Problem: 'scrolloff' remains at 1000 even after <F9> returns (Jakub
		         Turski)
		Solution: reset 'scrolloff' before quitting any of the windows created
		          during searching.
	* packages.vim:
		Problem: A spurious '{' is sometimes inserted into the search history.
				 ... (A. S. Budden, Mpiktas)
		Solution: call histdel once at the end of Tex_pack_all.
