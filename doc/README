In order to generate the html sources from the XML source, you will need to
do the following:

1. Download the Docbook XSL stylesheets from
    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21935
   I downloaded docbook-xsl-1.61.2.tar.gz
   Unpack this archive under the doc/ directory (like
   doc/docbook-xsl-1.XX.X) and rename the top-level directory from
   docbook-xsl-1.61.2/ to docbook/ If you prefer to extract this someplace
   else, make a symbolic link from that location to this one.

2. Download the Docbook DTD from
    http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2/docbook-xml-4.2.zip
   Extract this into
   docbook/xml/*
   CAUTION: the archive above does not create a top level directory but
   unzips directly into the present directory. Therefore, make sure to run
   the unzip from docbook/xml/

3. Download saxon.jar from
    http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/documentation/saxon.jar
   This is the bare .jar file without any of the other things which saxon
   comes with.
   Add the saxon.jar file to your $CLASSPATH setting.
   NOTE: The CLASSPATH setting should point to the saxon.jar file, not the
         directory where it resides.

4. Download db2vim (created by me :)) via anonymous cvs vim-latex.sf.net
   using
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.vim-latex.sf.net:/cvsroot/vim-latex co db2vim
   NOTE: This will create a directory db2vim in the present directory, so
         maybe perform this operation in ~/bin or something similar.
   Add the db2vim/ directory thus created to your $PATH setting.

5. Create a new directory latex-suite/ under the doc/ directory for the
   chunked html files to reside in. 

6. Copy Makefile.in to Makefile or makefile and perform any necessary
   customizations. For example, if you are using Activestate python under
   windows, you will need to change the ls-txt: target as:
        python e:/srinath/testing/db2vim/db2vim latex-suite.xml > latex-suite.txt


Thats it! You are ready. Now you can do

make ls-chunk
make ls-flat
make ls-txt

to create the 3 formats.
